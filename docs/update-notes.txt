1. Make sure whatever changes to the casper submodule are committed into the ‘customized’ branch

    cd content/themes/casper/
    git branch
    git status

2. Merge changes in this submodule from upstream master

    git checkout master
    git pull
    git checkout customized
    git merge master
    (If resolving merge conflicts, do so and)
    git commit -m "Merge with upstream master"
    (git push github customized)
   
3. Make sure the parent repository points to this new submodule commit hash

    cd ../../..
    git add content/themes/casper
    git commit -m "Point to new theme submodule" content/themes/casper

4. Update the parent respository

    git pull upstream stable
    (git push)

5. Reinstall potentially updated requirements

    npm install
    (This doesn’t echo output to screen for some reason so don’t panic. Also, if this fails as it often does, remove the node_modules folder and retry.)
    grunt init
    (If this fails as it often does, remove the bower_components folder and retry.)
    grunt prod

6. Restart the server
   forever stop index.js
   NODE_ENV=production forever start index.js
